Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances the capabilities of language models by providing them with access to external knowledge sources.

Text embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They are used to measure similarity between pieces of text.

Vector databases store these embeddings and allow for efficient similarity searches.

LangChain is a framework that facilitates the development of applications powered by language models. It provides tools for integrating LLMs with external data sources.

Evaluation metrics for RAG systems include precision, recall, and F1 score, which assess the quality of the generated responses.
