    "# 🎯 Building Your First Voice Agent\n",
    " \n",
    "Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of voice technology! In this notebook, you'll learn to build your own voice agent that can:\n",
    "- 🎤 Listen to your voice (Speech Recognition)\n",
    "- 🧠 Understand what you're asking\n",
    "- 🗣️ Respond with a voice (Text-to-Speech)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created your own personal assistant!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What You'll Learn\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Speech Recognition (ASR)** - How computers \"hear\" and understand speech\n",
    "2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - How computers can talk back to you\n",
    "3. **Natural Language Processing** - How computers understand meaning\n",
    "4. **Integration** - Putting it all together into a working voice agent\n",

    "## 🛠️ Step 1: Setting Up Our Tools\n",
    "First, we need to install the libraries that will help us build our voice agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What each library does:**\n",
    "- `speech_recognition`: Converts your speech to text (ASR)\n",
    "- `pyttsx3`: Converts text to speech (TTS)\n",
    "- `pyaudio`: Handles audio input/output\n",
    "- `requests`: Gets information from the internet\n",
    "- `datetime`: Works with dates and times"
