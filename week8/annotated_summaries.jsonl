In this paper, the authors explore the idea of using inference-time exploration as a form of supervision, by synthesizing a reference signal from a group of parallel rollouts and optimizing the model toward it. To test this approach, the authors trained a model on the Math-500 dataset using Compute as Teacher (CaT) to optimize the model's exploration behavior. They found that CaT was able to improve the model's performance compared to the original training procedure, with gains up to 27% on MATH-500 and 30% on HealthBench. The authors also explored using reinforcement learning (CaT-RL) to train the model, with gains up to 33% on MATH-500 and 30% on HealthBench. Overall, the results suggest that inference-time exploration can be a useful source of signals for training AI models, and that the use of reinforcement learning can further improve the model's performance. References: 1. [Compute as Teacher] 2. [CaT-RL] 3. [Qwen] 4. [Gemma] 5. [Llama] # What is the problem? The problem is the lack of a ground truth to train with. In some sense, this is a problem that is getting more and more important as the AI model becomes better at performing tasks that are not easily quantifiable (e.g. creative writing, artistic creation, etc). In these cases, the ability to train the model on the actual output would be incredibly useful, but it's not always possible to do so. The approach proposed by the authors is to use inference-time exploration as a form of supervision. Specifically, they use a group of parallel rollouts to generate multiple possible answers to a given question. Then, they use a frozen anchor (the initial policy) to reconcile the omissions and contradictions in the rollouts and estimate a reference. Finally, they use this reference as a reward signal to optimize the model's exploration behavior. The results of the experiments show that this approach is effective at improving the model's performance.

Key words: Fused Lasso, Regularization parameter selection, Spacing Test for Lasso, Selective inference, Change-point detection Introduction: Fused lasso and Spacing Test for Lasso: Fused lasso is a widely used technique for estimating a sparse signal by combining two penalties, one of which is based on the standard lasso and the other on the ridge penalty. The key benefit of this approach is the ability to jointly select the true sparsity pattern and the corresponding tuning parameters. The fused lasso has become a popular choice in machine learning problems, particularly for handling multiple feature interactions. One of the most important challenges in using the fused lasso is choosing the appropriate regularization parameters. This is because the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex, and the search space for tuning parameters is computationally expensive. In order to address this issue, Tibshirani et al. introduced the Spacing Test for Lasso (STL), which enables us to estimate the selection of changes in the true signal structure. In contrast to traditional methods, the STL provides conditional $p$-values for the selected change-points, making it easier to interpret the significance of detected changes. The STL has been widely adopted in signal processing applications, particularly for identifying changes in the signals and selecting a model for change points.

This suggests that the model is able to differentiate between the acquisition times of the datasets, even when the datasets themselves are similar.

These models have achieved impressive performance in these tasks, thanks to their ability to learn complex patterns from large amounts of text data. However, there are still limitations in their performance that limit their practical applications. One of the key challenges is the lack of explicit supervision in the form of labeled data. Traditional supervised learning methods require labeled data to train a model, but in the case of LLMs, we only have access to large amounts of text data. This makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of the model in certain tasks, such as sentiment analysis or text classification. Additionally, the models' ability to generalize to new data can be limited. LLMs often learn to perform well on specific tasks but struggle when confronted with new data that deviates from their training set. This makes it difficult to apply the model to new scenarios or domains, which is crucial for real-world applications. Another limitation is the reliance on massive amounts of data for training. The models need to process a significant amount of text data to learn complex patterns, which can be prohibitively expensive, especially in the context of natural language understanding. This makes it challenging to train models on limited data or in resource-constrained environments. To overcome these limitations, there is a growing interest in exploring different types of training objectives and techniques to improve the performance of LLMs. One promising direction is to use a combination of reinforcement learning and natural language understanding to improve the model's performance in real-world tasks. ## Reinforcement Learning", "prompt_1": "Please provide a comprehensive summary of the following research paper excerpt.

The key contributions of the paper are as follows: 1. The paper introduces a denoising framework for nonlinear dynamical systems that uses Runge-Kutta integration and total variation constraints. This approach has not been previously explored in the literature. 2. The paper proposes a novel method for representing the state trajectory with an INR, which is trained directly on noisy observations. This representation is not only efficient but also enables the calculation of first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. 3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of noise suppression, derivative estimation, and system identification. The experiments show that the denoised states and derivatives produced by RKTV-INR are both accurate and reliable. Methodology: The main idea of the paper is to represent the state trajectory with an INR that is trained directly on noisy observations. This INR is then used to generate a denoised state trajectory, which is subsequently used to recover the governing equations of the dynamical system. The paper follows a three-step approach: 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: The paper collects and preprocesses noisy observations of the state trajectory. The data is then divided into training, validation, and test sets. 2. Training of the INR: The paper uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to train the INR. The RNN is trained to predict the next state of the trajectory based on the current state and the noisy observations. The total variation constraint is imposed during training to ensure that the reconstructed trajectory remains close to the original data. 3. System Identification: The denoised states and derivatives are used to recover the governing equations of the dynamical system using SINDy. The SINDy algorithm identifies the key features of the dynamical system by iteratively solving a sparse regression problem. Key Findings: The main findings of the paper are as follows: 1. The proposed method effectively suppresses noise in the state trajectory and produces a denoised state trajectory that is close to the original data. 2.

The research paper focuses on the problem of estimating the unknown parameters in a statistical model when the data is collected adaptively. 2. The authors propose a method that provides valid inference for M-estimators that use adaptively collected bandit data with a (possibly) misspecified working model. 3. A key ingredient in their approach is the use of flexible machine learning approaches to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data collection. 4. The method enables the construction of valid confidence sets even in settings where treatment policies are unstable and non-converging, such as when there is no unique optimal arm and standard bandit algorithms are used. 5. Empirical results on semi-synthetic datasets constructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative demonstrate that the method maintains type I error control, while existing methods for inference in adaptive settings do not cover in the misspecified case.", "other": "In the presence of misspecified working models, current inference methods for adaptive data collection such as M-estimators fail to provide valid statistical inference. This paper proposes a new method that provides valid inference in such scenarios. The key innovation is the use of machine learning techniques to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data collection. The method maintains type I error control while current methods do not cover the misspecified case. Provide a brief context for the research question or problem the study addresses: The rapid growth of internet data collection has led to the development of adaptive data collection algorithms, such as those used in Bayesian or bandit algorithms. While these algorithms offer more efficient data collection than classical approaches, they also present new challenges in inference. One of these challenges is that classical statistical approaches such as OLS and $M$-estimation often fail to provide valid statistical inference for adaptive data collection. This is because the working model is typically misspecified and the variance induced by adaptive data collection is non-stationary. In addition, current methods for inference in adaptive settings are either inaccurate or fail to provide valid confidence intervals when the working model is misspecified. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new method that provides valid statistical inference for M-estimators used with adaptive data collection. Describe the approach taken to address the problem or question, and the methods and techniques used: The key to this new method is the use of a flexible machine learning approach, called the kernel-based variance stabilization approach, to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data collection. The method builds on recent work in machine learning that uses kernels to estimate the variance of a function, and modifies the approach to accommodate the misspecified working model. By using this approach, the method is able to maintain type I error control while existing methods for inference in adaptive settings do not cover the misspecified case. Provide a summary of the findings of the study, including any key results and conclusions: The new method for valid inference in adaptive data collection is able to maintain type I error control, while existing methods do not cover the misspecified case. This is a significant advance in the field of statistical inference for adaptive data collection, and opens up new possibilities for research and application. ### **What is the problem being solved or question being answered?** Describe the main issue or problem that your research is addressing.
